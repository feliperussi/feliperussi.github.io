I am a senior student majoring in Computer Science, Systems Engineering, and Mathematics at Universidad de los Andes. My interests include statistics, optimization, applying data science, machine learning or reinforcement learning across various fields, and human-robot interaction. I am looking forward  I also enjoy creating interfaces. In Mathematics, I am advised by [Mauricio Junca](https://math.uniandes.edu.co/~mjunca/), working on Variational Inference and Optimal Transport. In Computer Science and Systems Engineering, I am advised by [Rubén Manrique](https://academia.uniandes.edu.co/AcademyCv/rf.manrique), working on Natural Language Processing applied to biomedical texts, alongside [Carolina Salázar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carolinasalazarlara/?originalSubdomain=co). I am also working remotely with [Angelique Taylor](https://www.angeliquemtaylor.com/) at Cornell Tech’s lab, [AIRLab](https://sites.coecis.cornell.edu/ataylor/), developing interfaces for tele-operating robots with the goal of using them in medical environments.
